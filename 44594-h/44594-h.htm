  <p>Through the courtesy of Lord Nelson, the very curious Pack of Cards here presented in
  <i>facsimile</i> was placed at the disposal of the <span class="sc">Aungervyle Society of
  Edinburgh</span>. The Committee of this Society were very anxious to reproduce these extremely
  quaint memorials of a by-gone age, but on enquiry it was found that the cost of re-engraving the
  fifty-two cards on copper, the only really satisfactory method, would be far beyond the means of a
  Society then barely numbering 120 members.   Being Honorary Secretary both the Aungervyle and
  Clarendon Historical Societies, I suggested that the work should be undertaken at the joint
  expense of the two Societies. This was rather outside the plans of the Clarendon, but the
  Committee at length agreed to provide a portion of the necessary funds on condition that after the
  fifty-two cards had been re-produced in thirteen plates, accompanied by a small explanatory
  pamphlet, a second series of the Cards, the precise <i>fac-simile</i> of the originals, should be
  presented to each member of the two Societies. There still remained, however, a considerable sum
  to be raised. I thereupon proposed, after satisfying the above conditions, to purchase the plates
  from the Societies. These are now in my possession. The work, executed by the firm of Murdoch and
  Son, of this City, is perfect in every detail, and heavy though the cost has been, I feel sure
  that in this case at any rate, the object aimed at has been fully attained. Not a line, not a
  stroke of the original, but appears in exact counterpart in the reprint.</p>

  <p>Lord Nelson, unfortunately, had lost, or never had in his possession, two Cards, the ace and
  three of hearts. After much trouble, these have been supplied from another source, and, with the
  exception that the figures of Cromwell and Fairfax in the latter are on a somewhat smaller scale
  than those on the threes of the other suits, it would be difficult to suspect that they did not
  belong to the original pack.</p>

  <p>In the following notes, I have merely attempted to explain the allusions contained in the
  Cards. A few however remain riddles to me.</p>

        stamp, a gentleman of Surrey, of good parts and considerable revenue," successfully
        weathered the tempests of the period. He was commander at the siege of Basing House, was
        driven from the House of Commons by Pride's Purge, and was afterwards at the head of a
        Surrey regiment at Worcester. He spoke strongly in favour of Cromwell's becoming king. Later
        he became a member of the Convention Parliament which restored Charles II.</p>

        <p class="sp3">William Lenthall, of Lincoln's Inn, a Counsellor at Law, and Speaker of the
        House of Commons. "Oliver (Cromwell) once made a spunge of him, and squeezed him out of
        £15,000. Who turning him and his tribe out of doors, he veered about to save himself and his
        great offices; and he that had been so long bell-weather in the Commons House, was thought,
        for his compliance and his money, to deserve to be one of the herd of Lords in the Other
        House," (<i>Mystery of the Good Old Cause.</i>) John Lenthall, son of the speaker, was
        knighted by Oliver Cromwell, made a Colonel of foot, and governor of Windsor Castle.</p>
